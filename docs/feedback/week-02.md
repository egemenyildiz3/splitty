# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: You did have a chair and note take assigned for this meeting with the chair preparing an agenda.

#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: The initial agenda did not follow the provided template, but was uploaded in time the day before. I noticed that just before the meeting you changed it to the provided template with slight modification. I have to mention that I was a bit surprised to see a new agenda when I tried to open it for the meeting. From the next meeting please use the provided template as is (replace the <Agenda-item x> with the actual item) and don't make radical changes right before the meeting.

The inidividual points inside the agenda were great. You've managed to cover a lot of topics ranging from big to small ones. This is a great approach and I would encourage you to continue with it in future meetings as it provides a very clear schedule. Furthermore, the small one sentence explanations of what the topic is about provide great context for people who might not know what the topic is about (TA and/or team members). In the future this could also serve as examles of bugs, ideas with which people have came up and need discussion, etc.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Not applicable this week


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You've moderated the meeting very well. You covered all the topics that were in the (new) agenda in the appropiate amount of time, and moved the discussion along. I especially liked when you started asking people to take turns expressing their opinions the requirements as that included everyone in the discussion while facilitating the creation of new ideas.

I think that you've also managed really well with the distribution of the tasks for the Code of Conduct. By creating an order in which people would pick their tasks you removed a lot of uncertainty and saved time.

One point that I have to make is that the chair is expected to talk more than other team members, but in your case I believe that the distribution was a bit too uneven. Remember that the chair is there to moderate the meeting, not to do present the ideas and do most of the talking. In the future it would be great if you could shift the load a bit further from the chair and more towards the team as a whole.

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You did a great job at leading the meeting yourselves, to the point that there was little to no need for me to talk. Despite this, the discrepancy between the most talkative and least talkative people within the team make me a bit concerned about the distribution during your meetings. In this regard I would try to encourage you to aim for a more even distribution by asking questions (targeted or open-ended) and checking if everyone understood the discussion topic.

Overall I liked the atmophere during your meeting a lot. You've managed to stick to the points on the agenda while also adding a few jokes from time to time. While discussion certain topics people would raise great counterpoints that would then be discussed with everyone. These arguments would be respectful with everyone waiting for their turn.

Even though you're in the second week of the project, you've managed to still share feedback amongst eachother which was a good way to end the meeting.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: During this meeting you've touched upon great topics regarding the project itself. You've also approached this topic from a point of view that would help you meet the knock-out criteria (a current problem of the team), thus taking a more pragmatic approach. This is works great with the Agile way of working (see more in the lecture).

I liked that you've discussed ways to approach the application from a technical point of view by identifying the interdependence between issues and how the client and server relate to eachother.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: There were very few instances in which the work distribution seemed to be off. You do put effort into making sure that the available tasks are distributed fairly among team members. The discussion about making sure that everyone takes a look at merge requests in a roughly equal manner was a great point for your meeting.
