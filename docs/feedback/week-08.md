#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: You did have a chair and a note taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was uploaded on the main branch on GitLab on time and it followed the template with some improvements. Great use of subpoints to make the agenda more clear. I would like the points to be divided a bit better. Talking about the requirements could be separated into a lot of separate points, each with their own list of subpoints. It looks like each subpoints could actually be a discussion point on its own. You could also improve the formatting a bit by removing unnecessary empy lines between the points.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The notes were merged into the agenda file in a timely manner. The amount of notes is good and their structure is clear. The notes contain concrete agreements and assign people to actionable and realistic tasks.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You did cover all of the topics layed out in the agenda. You did a very good job on guiding the discussin towards splitting the tasks for the next sprints. You also involved others in the discussion by asking for their opinion. There were some situations in which you lost control of the meeting but that was only at the start. Great job on remembering any unclear points and asking for clarification.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You took ownership of the meeting and everyone was somewhat involved in the discussion. There were slight discrepancies but over all it was good. The athmosphere was constructive and there were some great discussions that arose during the meeting, especially regarding the money transfer and email features. Everyone was listened to and their ideas were taken into account.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You presented the current state of the application. The application is potentially shippable but there were features that were not merged into main. Make sure that if a feature is complete it is also merged into main. There was progress from last week, mainly towards flashing out the application and making it more usable and stable. You are on track to finish the basic features and a decent amount of the extra ones.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You discusses the action list of last week and everyone seemed to have finished their tasks. Based on this discussion it seems like you start testing only after you don't have anything else to do, which is not a good approach. It looks like you are all contirbuting quite equally to the project, which is great. I think based on this you should try distributing tasks a bit more evenly such that everyone gets to do tests while still working on other tasks.
