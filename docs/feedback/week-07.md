#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: You did have a chair and a minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The agenda was merged on main in a timely manner. It does follow the provided template.

The individual talking points are a bit unclear to me. For example, what is the difference between "Receive feedback on the project's current state from the TA" and "Show a demo of the app to TA". Furthermore you should add subpoints for each discussion topic to make it clear what exactly is going to be discussed (questions, examples to bring up, etc.). 

You should also have a subpoint that clarifies the work distribution for that discussion topic (if appicable). You do have a specific discussion point which also works but that should maybe be added at the end after the team has gone through all the other points.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: The notes were merged into the agenda file on the main branch. The amount of notes is good as each talking point has multiple takeaways from that speciffic discussion. Unfortunatelly, there are no concrete agreements that are distributed among team members. You only agreed on what the team as a whole should work on. The agreements are realistic.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: You were a bit confused on what was in the rubric and what you were supposed to do (you asked wether youshould do a demo even if it was still in the agenda). All the topics in the agenda were covered, however some extra discussions started.

Furthermore, you should have kept the discussion a bit more on track as sometimes the meeting started looking more like a free for all rather than an organized meeting. You should make sure that everyone is paying attention to one topic at a time.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: You took ownership of the meeting and didn't involve me too much. My involvement mostly came from questions or some oversights on your part when planning. The athmosphere was constructive and everyone was active in the discussion. A great observation is that everyone was involved in the discussion.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You presented the current state of the application. The application was working on the main branch meaning that the current product is potentially shippable. You have made progress compared to last week by implementing live updates through the usage of websockets. The application seems to be mostly done in terms of basic features but also in terms of extra features. You also mentioned that you plan to finish by the end of this week. Great job! 


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You discussed your action list from last week and it seems like you mostly achieved your goals with the exception of some small bugs. Your work distribution seems to be quite equal as well. Great job!
