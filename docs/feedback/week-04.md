#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: You did have a chair and a note taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: You added the agenda in time which is very nice. It follwed the provided template. The individual points have a sub-descriptions. Great job on making space for the demo but I do not see any time allocated for people to discuss what their tasks for the previous week were and how they went.

Furthermore, if you have few discussion points, either they are very big topics and require more explanation or you do not have many things to discuss. Based on how your meeting went it seems like the topics were large and therefore you should have split them into smaller ones or wrote more sub-points.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: The notes were merged on time. The amount of notes is good but the formating is a bick lacking. You do not make use of any of markdown's features to highlight what is going on. 

Furthermore, the used template is not standard. As stated during last week's feedbackI would suggest using the agenda template and writing the minutes under each of the covered topics. This way you will have a standard template for both documents and it is also easier to understand the context of the notes. Any additional information that you might have (eg. the task distribution) should be added at the end of the document.

It is great that you have clear agreements on who is going to work on what. Those agreements are also realistic. I would suggest making them more descriptive in the future.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: I did not say that I was finished with my word and you skipped to the next topic. Please make sure that the person speaking has finished. I like the fact that you were the one to do the demo. You managed to cover all the topics of the agenda.

However, you mostly let people discuss task disctributions for the next spring without any moderation. The discussion was more peero-to-peer rather than one moderated by a chair. Sometimes people spoke over eachother and it was hard to follow the discussion. I guess this is your style and it can work, but I would suggest trying to moderate the discussion a bit more. I liked that you checked if everyone agreed with the task distribution and tried to summarize the discussion at the end.

Your time estimation was not as stated in the agenda. The checkstyle discussion was longer than 5 minutes. From an agenda point of view, it shows that your estimations were not realistic. From a chair perspective, this shows that you do not take into account the schedule proposed during the agenda. Furthermore, you could hava modified it at the start of the meeting if you thought that it was not realistic.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You took ownership over the meeting with no interventions required on my part. Everyone was involved in the meeting and expressed their opinions. The atmosphere was great with everyone discussing the topic at hand while also maintaining a friendly attitude. There are some people that are not speaking as much as others during the meetings.

There were some instances in which people started talking over eachother and you should have payed attention to this more.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You presented the current state of the application and it looks like you have mostly implemented the basic requirements. The progres from last week is very visible. Doing progress like this, you will not only have a working application but will also be able to implement a lot of extra features. Great job!

There were a few bugs visible (the errors in the console) and some small features missing (joining by email or code doesn't ask you for any info about your bank account).

There is no checkstyle? That is pretty bad! You should make that a priority as it will get harder the more you wait.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: It seems like everyone did their work for this week but there was not specific time allocated to discuss this. I had to listen to your discussion and use the meeting notes and demo to figure out what tasks were done and which were not. This is not ideal is a crucial part of meeting. Next time please allocate some time to discussion who worked on what and what the results were. Did you encounter any problems?

Besides this, it looks like everyone is doing their part in this project and you are all contributing equally
