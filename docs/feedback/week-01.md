## Formative Meeting Feedback - W1

This week's meeting was ment for everyone in the team to get to know each other and help establish the basis for the team formation process. You were supposed to start discussing the project, the course schedule, and the Code of Conduct.

As mentioned, the TA is supposed to speak as little as possible therefore you will receive feedback on your self-organization.


#### 1) Self-organization - **Sufficient**

You did manage to somewhat lead the meeting yourselves but that was because the distribution was very unequal. Some people talked a lot while other barely talked.

From an organisation point of view I think that you did a decent job and can definitely work great between yourselves. However, I want to stress out again that it is very important for everyone to contribute as equally as possible.

Regarding the way in which the discussions were conducted I would also like to point out that to me it seemed like there was a bit of rigidity in some areas. Especially at the start of the project, I would encourage everyone to try to keep an open mind and express their opinions as it is heavily encouraged to have everyone work on all parts of the project (you may receive questions about any part of the application at the end of the project).

#### 2) Suggested Topics - **Good**

Topics wise, I think that you did a decent job at covering everything that was planned for the meeting. I think that you could have covered some of the topics a bit more in-depth, but for a first meeting your time management was good. 

I especially liked how you discussed how certain features of the project would impact the way in which you design the app as it provides a good starting point and brings up everyone in the team up to the same level of understanding.
