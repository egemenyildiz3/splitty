#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: You did have a chair and minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: The agenda was merged on time on the main branch of the repository but you do not follow the template provided in the course. I think you are using an outdated version (look at W4 for the right one). The agenda also didn't allocate time for a demo or to discuss what everyone has been working on in the previous weeks.

The meeting points were very broad and they did not provide any explanation for what id going to be discussed through the use of subpoints. Make sure to make concrete and descriptive points that are further expanded using subpoints (if necessary).

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: The notes were merged into the main branch of the application while following the agenda template. The amount of notes taken is good as each talking point has multiple notes taken. The clarity of the notes could have been improved a bit as some of the notes are a bit vague ("statistics - try to finish"). The notes should contain concrete agreements which can be quantified.

It is great that you have a list of action items assigned for each team member. Continue doing that as it is a great way to keep track of who is doing what. Do make them more specific and detailed in the future.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: The agenda was vague and because of that it was hard for everyone to follow the meeting. At one point you lost control of the meeting completely and people were doing their stuff without following any plan (the agenda). There were some instances in which people started speaking over you and you backed down. Remember that the chair should be the one to lead the meeting.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: The athmosphere was great with everyone being active and involved in the discussion. The team took ownership of the meeting and everyone was listened to and ideas/comments/questions were taken into account. At one point people started talking over eachother and were not listening to the chair. This is something that should be avoided in the future.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You showed a demo of the application with some new features from the last demo. The progress was good and the application seems to be almost done with the basic requirements. The admin panel is supposedly there but I was not able to see it. The progress is less than expected for a two week period but given that you had midterms it is fine. You seem to have only a few small additions to make for all the basic requirements to be done. Furthermore you are also working on some extra features.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: You did not discuss the action list from last week. It is not clear if everyone reached their goals. It is very hard to gauge if everyone contributed equally to project.
